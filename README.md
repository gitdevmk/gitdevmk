👋 Hi, I’m @gitdevmk. I initially got started with coding and development during my college days when I was introduced to programming courses. The problem-solving aspect and the ability to create something tangible fascinated me, leading me to dive deeper into the world of coding.

👀 I’m interested in various technologies and frameworks, but web development and open-source projects hold a special place in my heart. The dynamic nature of web technologies and the collaborative nature of open source always keep me engaged.

🌱 I’m currently learning new things to enhance my skill set. Lately, I've been exploring the world of containerization and orchestration, particularly focusing on Docker and Kubernetes. The scalability and efficiency they bring to software development have caught my attention.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects, especially those related to building scalable web applications or contributing to open-source initiatives. I believe in the power of teamwork and the diverse perspectives it brings to the table
